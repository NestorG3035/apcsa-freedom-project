##### **Sources:**
I am using the Tinkercad Website to simulate the Arduino Project. This simulation allows me to tinker with the arduino board, wires and gadgets that each have different functions.
This provides a free learning experience for the user.  
I am also the Arduino to learn how to use the Arduino board and its little gadgets. The arduino software provides Mini Lessons/examples that teach the user how to use the Arduino commands and instruct students how to built useful tools/gadgets.
This provides a deeper understanding of the software Arduino functions.

#### **Engineering Process Design:**
I am in Stage 4 of the Engineering Process Design. The tool Im creating, the Smart Window, is made of Polymer Dispered Liquid Crystals that become blurry or transparent when a certain amount of voltage is applied to the liquid crystals. An Arduino tool that would change the voltage level applied to an object is the Toggle.
Using the arduino, a lightbulb, and a toggle, I can learn how  I must know how to use toggles to increase or decrease voltage levels. So far, I have learned how to use Arduino code to send voltage to turn on a lightbulb. 
In doing so, I learn to use Arduino voltage. **My plan** is to now is to control voltage levels on that lightbulb, so that the light it produces increases or decreases. This will teach me how to change voltage levels on the smart glass, so that the liquid crystals have different levels of transparency.  
#### **Knowledge:**
Something I am learning in this class that can be used in this project is the use of variables and if/else statements. When I used the Arduino IDE, I saw that a huge amount of code was similar to the code used in Java. I can use if statements to control what happens on my board.       Example:  ```if(voltage level== integer){ brightness++} ```.        
#### **Skills:**
A skill I am developing that applies in things outside of my project is my **problem decomposition** skills. Before, I did not know when and what to do to start my project. I took a breath and broke down my project into smaller pieces:  
* Research the components that make up my project (Here I learned that the glass I needed had polymer dispersed liquid crystals inside it. I also learned that I needed Arduino to use voltage.)
* Search the Price, is it affordable?
* Learn my tool(Here I learned how to use my tool and its codes) 

This has taught me to break things down and to not procrastinate when working on something important to get the best result.  

Another skill I developed was my **How to read/reading** skills. This skill taught me to analyze articles, websites and sources so that I can learn to use code. Now I dont feel uncomfortable learning new topics and visitting un-known websites. I can also tackle huge long worded paragraphs. Before, I used to ignore long paragraphs, but thanks to this paragraph, I read them and learn new things.
