### **Sources:**
As I stated in my previous blog entry, I am using the Tinkercad Arduino board simulator. This allows me to tinker with an artificial Arduino board for FREE. It includes all the features of the arduino. Not only do I save money, I dont have to deal with wires and losing little arduino parts. I dont have to deal with packing things up or putting parts where they go, this method is time efficient.  The Arduino Software provides free lessons and examples to help the user learn how to tinker with the arduino to create awesome projects.

### **Engineering Process Design:**
I am still in Stage 4 of my Engineering Process design. Stage 4 is the planning stage. Im still deciding what parts of the arduino kit I will include and what parts I will exclude from my project. I am also planning on what the design of the project will be. The tool Im creating, the Smart Window, is made of Polymer Dispered Liquid Crystals that become blurry or transparent when a certain amount of voltage is applied to the liquid crystals. So far, I know I will need to use the arduino toggle to send different levels of voltage to the glass. I must learn how to connect the arduino board to a sheet of polymer dispersed liquid crystals.  **My plan** now is to learn how to control voltage levels on a lightbulb, so that the light it produces increases or decreases. This will teach me how to change voltage levels on the polymer dispersed liquid crystals, so that the liquid crystals have different levels of transparency.

### **Knowledge:**
As stated in my previous blog entry, something I am learning in this class that can be used in this project is the use of variables and if/else statements.  I saw that a huge amount of code used in the Arduino IDE was similar to the code used in Java. I can use if statements to control what happens on my board.       Example:  ```if(voltage level== integer){ brightness++} ```
### **Skills:**

A skill I have refined since my last blog entry was my communication skills. Between this blog entry and the last, my computer broke down. The hard drive fried and I didnt have access to money to fix it. Now its fixed. During the time my computer was damaged, I had to contact my teacher, Mr. Mueller, to ask him for extensions to certain assignments. I felt embarrassed at first and didnt want to speak up, but I would hurt my grade and get a 0 if I didn't contact him. Another new skill I refined was my time management skill. Since I am very busy after school (as a result of extracurricular sports), I rarely have time to do freedom project and edhesive assignments. My solution to this problem was watching edhesive lessons during my trip to school to not slack behind and still have time for my sport after school.
